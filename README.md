# SPMSWebsite
This is HTML5 code for the Seattle Precision Machine Shop website.  

Since my business is largely philanthropic and based on past experience with template and using other 
web development services provided by I decided to let the community help develop our website.  

This will alow the best results.

I have all the pics, etc. required to make this site complete.  

Anyone that wants to contribute to the project even to test code on browsers (IE, Firefox, Chrome)

I added a website proposal in .docx

Project is to complete the HTML code, make sure it is accurate, responsive, then add styles and content. 

I copied out some code I found that should help the project along.

My old site(s)

http://precisionmachineshop.webs.com
https://precisionpressworkinc.webs.com/

these both will be removed once the project is complete.

The new domain is parked on GoDaddy at http://www.seattleprecision.com/ awaiting publishing to host.  

I am pretty sure we will host locally on a Apache or IIS host on a Dell R710.

I'm figuring the site should use ~4-8 pages.

Page 1) index.htm;
Page 2) about.htm;
Page 3) contact.htm;
Page 4) careers.htm;
Page 5) capabilities.htm
Page 5) quote.htm
Page 6) gallery.htm



The colors will be:
1)    #08b2e1
      rgb(8, 178, 225)
      hsl(193, 93%, 46%)

2)    #97b824
      rgb(151, 184, 36)
      hsl(73, 67%, 43%)

3)    #319185
      rgb(49, 145, 133)
      hsl(173, 49%, 38%)

4)    #293077
      rgb(41, 48, 119)
      hsl(235, 49%, 31%)
